## To-do list
- Cleanup/refactor the extractor's code
- Add an option to extract pictures as .TIM; I handled semitransparency in a rather kludgy way when converting to .TGA, so extracting picture-related material in their raw form would be preferable.
- Extract music
- Extract textures
- Extract item-related sprites
